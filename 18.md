# 1 Introduction and flat files

In this chapter, you'll learn how to import data into Python from all types of flat files, which are a simple and prevalent form of data storage. You've previously learned how to use NumPy and pandas—you will learn how to use these packages to import flat files and customize your imports.

## 1.1 Welcome to the course!

## 1.2 Exploring your working directory

In order to import data into Python, you should first have an idea of what files are in your working directory.

IPython, which is running on DataCamp's servers, has a bunch of cool commands, including its [magic commands](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html). For example, starting a line with `!` gives you complete system shell access. This means that the IPython magic command `! ls` will display the contents of your current directory. Your task is to use the IPython magic command `! ls` to check out the contents of your current directory and answer the following question: which of the following files is in your working directory?
